# Part 2

## Column 1

### Outline

The second part of this workshop taps into the critical appraisal of your model. Bayesian analyses (as a matter a fact, all statistical analyses) are full of choices. So, as a researcher, it is our duty to understand what we are doing and provide evidence and arguments for the validity of our choices. To increase reproducibility, we tap into how you can use the WAMBS check-list to inform readers about our choices and decisions on the choice of priors, model convergence, and prior sensitivity.
